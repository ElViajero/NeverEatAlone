Iteration Plan

Iteration 3: Initial Implement / Test
Server side: 



Client side: 
Using the Android SDK 21, we created a simple GUI, consisting of:
- Login page 
- Registration page
We able to get the user name, email address, password. We have the "login" activity and the "register" activity complemeted. But we have not linked this to the server.

This set up works, but requires proper dependencies in place, including: 
- TomEE Plume 1.7.1
- Neo4j Community 2.1.5
- Apache Httpcomponents Client 4.3.5
- Java EE 6
- Android SDK 21 (+ ADT plugin in eclipse)
- Java SE 1.8


Iteration 4: Core Working
We will connect the client side and server side.
Functionalities we have hope to complete include:
- Registration
- Login
- Logout


Iteration 5: Alpha Release


Iteration 6: Project Completion
