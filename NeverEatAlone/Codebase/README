DO NOT USE localhost. The localhost usually refers to the android emulator. So you won't be able to reach the server. | |

I've just updated the JSon request/response architecture and so the tests need an overhaul before they can be run.    | |
As they are now, best case they fail because the string returned is now a JSon string.                                | |

Most warnings were fixed (over 200).                                                                                                                       | |
There are some 8 remaining warnings, some of them are to do with the Android SDK and some are due to the use of deprecated functionality.                  | |
Some of them are due to XML validation that Eclipse does. It can be turned off as it is not relevant to our project.                                       | |

They are top priority and will be taken care of first thing at the beginning of the next iteration.                                                        | |
We have taken note of the catching and throwing of Exceptions as opposed to subclasses and will correct                                                    | |
the issue in the beginning of the next iteration. We apologize for the delay.                                                                              | |
This iteration, we were focused on trying to get data on to the GUI.                                         	                                           | |

Sometimes, you may get compile errors even though there are none. The most common source of bugs is the m2eclipse plugin which seems to i                  | |
contradict (sometimes) how eclipse wants to handle the build path.                                                                                         | |

Right click --> maven --> update.                                                                                                                          | |
Selecting maven dependencies in build path order and export,                                                                                               | |
Removing and re-adding src,gen,res,                                                                                                                        | |
And project clean and rebuild should fix this.                                                                                                             | |

If not, you may have to restart eclipse.                                                                                                                   | |

Log into "a" click "create", fill the fields and click the next button.                                           | |

You should see the Meal properties being posted on the invites list as well as (briefly)                          | |
to screen showing successful functioning of the notification framework.                                           | |

IN THIS ITERATIon,THE INITIAL DESING OF ALL THE SUPPORT FRAMEWORKS REQUIRED                                       | |
FOR THE FUNCITonALITY THAT THE APP HAS TO OFFER HAS BEEN COMPLETED.                                               | |
                                                                                                                  | |
However, there is still some considerable tweaking and refactoring to do.                                         | |
                                                                                                                  | |
There is some functionality that has been implemented on the server side (such as contacts add etc.)              | |
but for which the GUI pages have not been developed yet.                                                          | |
                                                                                                                  | |
The only test that is guaranteed is the one above. Beause as it stands, the event handlers for                    | |
certain buttons etc. haven't been properly hooked up to transisition smoothly from one GUI page to another.       | |
