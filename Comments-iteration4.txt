Group 19,

You have very detailed setup/deploy instructions, which is good.
Besides the warnings you listed in "known issues", you had 11 "not used" warnings and 2 "raw type" warnings.
Although your instructions suggest that the deployer customize the IPAddress field in some config files, your unit tests don't use this configuration, hardcoding the ip address instead.
In order to follow your setup instructions, I need a version of Maven newer than the one in Debian Unstable; that's a bad sign. Consider just including the relevant appcompat libraries rather than trying to fetch them via Maven.
You should not be hard-coding contacts in your ContactsActivity, even for testing.
Why are you using List<String> in your RegisterRequestProperties instead of just String. Regardless, it's bad form to have parrallel lists, so if you do need a list, you should be using a list of triples, not a triple of lists.
"Username", "Password", and "Email" (among many others) violate java naming conventions. Fields must start with a lowercase letter.
Consider using log4j for your debug output instead of plain System.out.println.
You pervasively use Strings, String arrays, and Maps from Strings; in many cases, this is in violation of OO design.

I couldn't run your code, so I couldn't test your application. Based on your iteration page, I can see that you made a good amount of progress. That said, you have numerous egregious design and style decisions.

Total Grade: 92/100
