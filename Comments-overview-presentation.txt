Group 19,

You did a good job motivating your application.

The main criticisms I have about your presentation are:
  - The text of your class diagram was too small to read, even from the front of the room.
  - Some of your presentation was spent just reading the slides.
  - You ran out of time and couldn't demo.

I also am dubious of the "everything string" idea you suggested toward the end of your presentation. This is likely to be bad OO design.

Total Score: 96/100
