Group 19,

You have a very well fleshed-out design; there are a few minor presentation issues, but overall, you've succeeded in the goal for iteration 1.

Your feature list is detailed and gives the reader a good sense of what the app will do.

Your domain model is hard to follow. Part of this is due to its layout; part is due to the fact that it seems to be missing some core abstractions (e.g. a "Meal Event" object, as distinct from "Meal Notification").
Also, you need to annotate edges, at least with arities.
Although the domain model contains a lot of design detail, it doesn't really explain the domain; it should spend less time/space on how exactly you're going to implement features.

Your GUI sketches, use cases, and activity diagram are great.

one minor criticism: don't use JPEG for diagrams; use PNG.

Overall, good job!

Total Score: 94/100
