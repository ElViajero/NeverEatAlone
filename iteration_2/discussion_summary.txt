Discussion Summary for all things except GUI design 
--------------------------
Changes to Domain Model
(I may forget or misunderstand some part of this, Tejas and Yueling may modify it as you agreed on):

   * Change "Meal Notification Information”  to "Meal Information”
   * Change “Deferred Notification List” to “Inactive Notification List” 
   * Add an “Active Notification List” for received notification
   * Add a “Wait-to-send Notification List”(or whatever name it is) for scheduled invitation notification 

----------------------------
Changes to use-cases

* Modify: use-case for creating an account 
Need to check the availability and validity of the user name; check the consistency and validity of the password.(e.g., we can set the length limit for the password)

* Add: Use-case for Log-in 
The user can choose the availability status when logging in, if not chosen, use the default status.

* Add: Use-case for Log-out
When logged out, the availability status should be set to “unavailable”.

* Add: use-case to set default availability status at login 

* Add: use-case to delete(or cancel) an invitation

* Add: use-case to close an invitation
Any of the 3 conditions can trigger this use case: 
1, attendance limitation is reached; 
2, the post ending time is reached;
3, the user choose to close the invitation manually. 

* Add: use-case to set alias for contacts 
Alias will override username in display. Can be sorted by last name. 

------------------------
Extended Features:

   * User who receives a meal notification push can accept or decline it on the lock screen
   * User who receives a meal notification push and click on the lock screen to see more detailed information of the notification 
   * Use Facebook or other account information to log in 
   * Search contacts (for adding) using true name, work place or phone number 
   * Use geo information to search for contacts (both for adding friend and for searching within contact list) 
   * Display contacts in different orders in contact list, adding a separate page for choosing sorting methods. 
   * Schedule availability (remove it from the core feature list) 

------------------------
Miscellaneous (Only for extended features) 

* Priority of “availability setting” 
Login choice > Manually click the button > default login status > scheduled availability 

* Scheduled availability is just two actions in implementation: turning on availability at the starting time and turning off availability at the ending time. We can also consider logging in at 3/4 of the scheduled time period, then this period automatically becomes invalid. But that’s for the extended feature.
