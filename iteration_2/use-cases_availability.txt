Suggested changes to GUI
1. "Set Visible List" -> "Set Visibility List" Do we need a separate page? 
2. Add availability indicator (color or text) to Contacts page
3. Add a View Profile page for viewing profile of friends. Include the availability indicator. 
4. "Edit" button on the Schedule Availability page is not necessary
